    "Step 1: Define the problem:\n",
    "- We are given a probability distribution $ p(y) = \\frac{\\lambda^y}{y!} e^{-\\lambda} $, which represents the number of seedlings in a given area, where $ \\lambda $ is the mean density of seedlings per square yard.\n",
    "- The forester randomly locates ten 1-square-yard sampling regions in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Identify the parameters:\n",
    "- The mean density of seedlings is given as $ \\lambda = 5 $ per square yard.\n",
    "- We have $n = 10 $ sampling regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Determine the probability of interest:\n",
    "- We want to find the probability that none of the regions will contain seedlings, i.e., $ P(Y = 0) $, where $ Y $ is the number of seedlings in a 1-square-yard sampling region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Use the given probability distribution:\n",
    "- Substitute $ \\lambda = 5 $ and $ y = 0 $ into the probability distribution formula:\n",
    "  $ P(Y = 0) = \\frac{5^0}{0!} e^{-5} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Calculate the probability:\n",
    "- Compute the value of $ P(Y = 0) $ using the formula:\n",
    "  $ P(Y = 0) = e^{-5} \\approx 0.0067 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Interpret the result:\n",
    "- The probability that none of the ten 1-square-yard sampling regions will contain seedlings is approximately 0.67%.\n"
